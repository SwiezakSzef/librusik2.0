## Reporting a bug

**Feel free** to open new issues when something doesn't work or you want to ask for new features/improvements.

If you encounter a bug, remember to attach some logs (exception traceback or just a detailed description).

Also, **[ping me somewhere](https://dani3l0.dev/#contact)** so we can test whether fixes work as intended as I have no access to Librus anymore.

## Some other words

Because this was my first app written in Python, code is a terrible mess. Don't expect it to be super readable and flexible.

_It just works_ (It actually worked since 2019 xD)
